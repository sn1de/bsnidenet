This post is the first one done after setting up CICD to 
trigger deployment to AWS when the GitHub repository is 
updated. A github action is triggered which will build 
the production version of the bridgetown site and then 
sync that to the site's AWS S3 bucket. Then the 
cloudfront distribution will be invalidated in order 
to pick up the changes. Let's see if it works!
